O gentle moon, that climbs the silent night,
And bathes the world in silver, soft and bright,
What dreams dost thou inspire in hearts forlorn,
What hope dost thou restore with every morn?

Upon the breeze, sweet whispers drift and play,
As lovers' vows and secrets fade away.
Yet in the quiet, stars their watch do keep,
And cradle all our longing as we sleep.
